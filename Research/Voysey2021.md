## Safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2: an interim analysis of four randomised controlled trials in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK


> There  were  74341  person-months  of  safety  follow-up  (median  3·4  months,  IQR  1·3–4·8):  175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation.

### METHODS

Pooled data from 5 distinct trial of the ChAdOx1 (AZD1222) vaccine that essentially followed the same protocol, with a few discrepencies predominantly in the much earlier UK based trials. 

The protocol was amended on  June  5,  2020,resulting  in  enrolment  of  two  distinct  groups  with  different  dosing  regimens  with  no  pause  in enrolment (version 6.0; appendix 2 p 330). A suite of assays  has  now  been  developed  for  characterisation  of  concentration  (which  confirmed  the  low  and  standard  dosing),   and   future   batches   are   all   released   with   a   specification  dose  of  3·5–6·5×10¹⁰  viral  particles,  and  this was used for the booster doses in the efficacy analysis presented here

|Study|Population|Intervention|Control|
|-----|----------|------------|-------|
|COV001 (Phase 1/2)|Healthy adults 18-55 yo (N = 1077) at five sites in the UK begining from April 23 2020; participants were randomised 1:1|Initially commenced as a single dose study of 5\*10^10 viral particles, trial protocol was modified on July 30 to include an unblinded second dose of the same vaccine; N=88 participants remained with only a single dose|control participants were administere the MenACWY conjugate vaccine|
|COV002 (Phase 2/3)|Healthy adults 18-55 yo were recruited from May 28 2020
